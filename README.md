# Netflix Clone in Java with MVC and Ant

This project is a Netflix clone developed in Java using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern and the Ant build tool.

The goal of this project is to recreate the basic functionality of Netflix, allowing users to register, browse, and stream movies and TV shows. The MVC design pattern has been employed to clearly separate responsibilities and improve code maintainability.

The MVC pattern divides the application into three main components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application. In this project, the model includes classes representing movies, series, users, etc., as well as the logic to manage playlists and interact with the data.

- **View**: Handles the presentation of the user interface. In this case, graphical interfaces have been implemented to enable users to interact with the application, explore the content catalog, and stream movies and series.

- **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view, managing user interactions and coordinating data updates. In this project, the controller is responsible for receiving user actions, communicating with the corresponding model, and updating the view accordingly.

Additionally, the Ant build tool has been used for project construction and management. Ant allows for the automation of common build tasks such as compiling source code, packaging required files, and running tests.

With this Netflix clone, a robust and scalable Java application has been achieved, following software design best practices and utilizing tools like the MVC pattern and Ant to ensure an organized structure and an efficient build process.
